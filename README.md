# mini_twitch
Testing twitch integration using C++. Using cURL and nlohmann::json libs as external deps (included).

It implements a basic account linking with a twitch app. Do not use this into production. I have disabled the ssl certifications checks in windows because of the cURL version I'm using.

# Platforms

Tested in OSX & Windows
